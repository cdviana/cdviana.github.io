#### Slope stability assessment based on a Digital Outcrop Model: a case-study at Jardim Garcia quarry
Full paper presented as a poster at te 14th International Congress on Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, at Foz do Iguassu - Brazil.

#### Abstract
In this work a 3D digital model generated with SfM-MVS is used to investigate rock slope stability. The test site is a deactivated quarry used as recreational area for climbers. The model was divided in three sectors. Sector 1 has the least steep slope and structures are par-allel to slope face. Sectors 2 and 3 have steeper slope angles and are prone to wedges. The work has demonstrated that the application of a 3D model generated with SfM-MVS workflow for rock slope stability analysis is feasible and can find future application in climbing sites.
