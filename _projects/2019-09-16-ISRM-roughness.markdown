#### SfM-MVS digital models applied to rock surface roughness
Full paper presented as a poster at te 14th International Congress on Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, at Foz do Iguassu - Brazil.

#### Abstract
This work proposes the application of two 3D digital models of rock surfaces gen-erated through the SfM-MVS workflow to obtain surface parameters such as the surface rough-ness coefficient. Two case studies are presented: Model 1 is a fault surface on a limestone and Model 2 is a fracture surface on a granite block. A Barton comb profilometer was used on Model 2 to compare field and digital JRC results. The work has demonstrated that the application of a 3D model generated with SfM-MVS workflow for rock roughness analysis is feasible and can find future application in rock mechanics.
